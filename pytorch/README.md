# Coulomb GAN

This repository contains an implementation of Coulomb GANs as depicted in the paper "Coulomb GANs: Provably Optimal Nash Equilibria via Potential Fields" by Unterthiner et al.

## Reproducing Paper results
Note: this is a re-implementation of the original TF implementation that also resides in this repository. However, results should be comparable, though I haven't evaluated that thoroughly.

## Requirements
The implementation was developed in Python 3.6 using Pytorch 0.3, but should work with any version of Python 3.5+.

## Licensing
Note that the code is provided "as-is" under the terms of the General Public License v2. See `LICENSE.txt` for the full details.
